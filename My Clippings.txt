IgM is our “early defense” antibody against antigens. It’s highly effective at tagging invaders for destruction by other cells, but it has a short life-span. So after IgM is produced, B cells switch over to IgG production, which gives us longer-term protection against an antigen. These IgG antibodies can linger for years or even a lifetime. IgA antibodies are the antibodies we have the most of, and that’s because they have to cover all of our mucosal surfaces, like our mouth, lungs, sinuses, and GI tract.

During deep sleep it’s normal to have higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6, which are triggered by melatonin and direct your immune cells to attack and kill anything that has found its way into your body during the day.

Obesity is itself a chronic inflammatory condition, because adipose (fat) cells secrete their own entourage of proinflammatory chemicals called adipokines. In fact, obese individuals can have a threefold increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP), all further contributing to chronic disease and accelerated aging.

Why are lymphatics so important? One, they deliver information about those toxins in your body to the immune cells so they can destroy or neutralize harmful substances. Two, the lymphatic system carries away harmful substances and any by-products formed by them. Three, they aid in the cleanup process to help heal and rebuild molecules in the area.

Inflammation in short periods is a good thing, because it’s a sign that your immune system is fighting foreign substances. Unfortunately, there are two phases of the inflammatory process. The first is pro-inflammation (taking care of the toxins and invaders), and the second is the cleanup and reparative stage. If this second stage is delayed or never happens, it can lead to autoimmune disease or chronic inflammation. But chronic inflammation—what happens when your arterial walls are constantly damaged—is what puts your body under constant stress, as it’s unable to keep up with the steady fights happening at the cellular level.

Not only do lymphatics perform the usual functions of immune support, fluid balance, and waste clearance, but they are also essential for large protein and fat molecules being transported from the gastrointestinal tract to the rest of the body. This is important because when the lymph system becomes porous and vital substances leak into other tissues, you lose the nutritional power of those substances, like vitamins, proteins, and other chemicals.

flow determines how the lymph nodes can identify (and thus get rid of) unwanted antigens. By that measure, the sooner these antigens can be carried by the lymphatic vessels to immune cells to establish a significant response, the sooner the inflammation can be cleared up.

extra weight is associated with increased risk of just about every health problem—heart attacks, cancer, fatigue, depression, sleep issues, inflammation, and more. One of the reasons: Fat, especially abdominal fat, is toxic to the organs that it’s near. It releases damaging and inflammatory substances that create all kinds of chaos throughout the body.

Whenever your muscles contract, they gently push the lymph fluid along. In addition, muscle contraction is one of the best ways to control the pressure of the lymphatic system, especially the core muscle of the diaphragm, which impacts the larger central lymphatic vessels that pass alongside of this muscle on their way to return lymph to the heart.

lymphatic system operates through pressure—and in-and-out rhythm—it does need something to constantly “prime the pump,” i.e., move the fluids along. A major pressure pump: deep, diaphragmatic breathing. This is why yoga stretches, yoga deep breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, and meditation are so crucial to healthy flow.

When they’re under stress—as the case when you lift something, be it a weight or your own body weight—the structures of the muscle break down and get torn apart. Your body knows this, repairs the damage, and builds them back up—this time, better and stronger in anticipation that you’ll do the damage again. This process is what builds all-important muscle in your body.

Yoga, on the other hand, essentially sends a shut-the-heck-up signal to the Golgi bodies, so that they do not engage.

where does the lymph come in? This muscle movement pushes lymph along, as it squeezes the lymph through the channels. But it also plays a role in allowing your muscles to relax, with assistance from the relaxation hormones triggered by yoga. This relaxation is key because it assists the flow in absence of that central pump, not to mention that different body positions sort of jostle the fluid in different directions—allowing gravity to assist in the up-down path that lymph must take to be most effective.

once you throw the Old Testament into the mix, things get completely jumbled. The authors of Job and Ecclesiastes explicitly state that there is no afterlife. The book of Amos insists that the people of God suffer because God is punishing them for their sins; the book of Job insists that the innocent can suffer; and the book of Daniel indicates that the innocent in fact will suffer.

To maintain the same volume of blood flow through our narrowed and stiffened blood vessels, the heart has to generate increased pressure. As a result, more than half of us develop hypertension by the age of sixty-five.

You do not worry about losing any of your capabilities. People tell you “the world is your oyster,” “the sky is the limit,” and so on. And you are willing to delay gratification—to invest years, for example, in gaining skills and resources for a brighter future. You seek to plug into bigger streams of knowledge and information.

There were also hundreds of indoor plants and a thriving vegetable and flower garden. The home had on-site child care for the staff and a new after-school program. Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase’s residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent. The study couldn’t say why. But Thomas thought he could. “I believe that the difference in death rates can be traced to the fundamental human need for a reason to live.”

In the early 1970s, the psychologists Judith Rodin and Ellen Langer performed an experiment in which they got a Connecticut nursing home to give each of its residents a plant. Half of them were assigned the job of watering their plant and attended a lecture on the benefits of taking on responsibilities in their lives. The other half had their plant watered for them and attended a lecture on how the staff was responsible for their well-being. After a year and a half, the group encouraged to take more responsibility—even for such a small thing as a plant—proved more active and alert and appeared to live longer.

Royce wanted to understand why simply existing—why being merely housed and fed and safe and alive—seems empty and meaningless to us. What more is it that we need in order to feel that life is worthwhile? The answer, he believed, is that we all seek a cause beyond ourselves. This was, to him, an intrinsic human need. The cause could be large (family, country, principle) or small (a building project, the care of a pet). The important thing was that, in ascribing value to the cause and seeing it as worth making sacrifices for, we give our lives meaning.

In the first stage, when a country is in extreme poverty, most deaths occur in the home because people don’t have access to professional diagnosis and treatment. In the second stage, when a country’s economy develops and its people transition to higher income levels, the greater resources make medical capabilities more widely available. People turn to health care systems when they are ill. At the end of life, they often die in the hospital instead of the home. In the third stage, as a country’s income climbs to the highest levels, people have the means to become concerned about the quality of their lives, even in sickness, and deaths at home actually rise again.

The day the lambs were slaughtered? How can that be? In Mark’s Gospel, Jesus lived through that day, had his disciples prepare the Passover meal, and ate it with them before being arrested, taken to jail for the night, tried the next morning, and executed at nine o’clock A.M. on the Passover day. But not in John. In John, Jesus dies a day earlier, on the Day of Preparation for the Passover, sometime after noon.

The commonly held view that Judas went out and “hanged himself” comes from Matthew (27:3–10). After Judas sees that his betrayal has led to Jesus’ conviction, he feels remorse and tries to return his pay of thirty pieces of silver to the Jewish chief priests, telling them that he has “sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They refuse to accept the money, however, so he throws it down in the Temple and goes out and hangs himself. The chief priests then collect the money, but decide that they cannot put it back into the Temple treasure because it is “blood money”—money that has been tainted with innocent blood. So they decide to put it to good use and purchase a “potter’s field,” presumably a field from which potters took clay, as a place to bury foreigners who died in Jerusalem. It is because it was purchased with Judas’s blood money, we are told, that the place “has been called the Field of Blood to this day.”

Paul’s letter to the Galatians he wants to insist that his Gospel message came directly from God himself, through Jesus. He didn’t get it from anyone else—not even the other apostles—so anyone who disagrees with him about the Gospel is really disagreeing not with him but with God. The writer of the book of Acts, on the other hand, wants to insist that there was complete continuity in every way among all the genuine apostles of Jesus, both the original disciples and Paul. They met, they talked, they agreed—time and again this is stated in Acts. For Paul himself, however, the issue is his authority, given straight from God. He did not confer with others or meet with the apostles. The two authors have different agendas and so have recounted the events differently—creating an interesting but important discrepancy.

scholars have sometimes suggested that Mark’s account was written in part to provide hope for those suffering persecution, to let them know that, appearances notwithstanding, God was at work behind suffering to achieve his redemptive purposes. What might Luke’s purpose have been in modifying Mark’s account, so that Jesus no longer dies in agony and despair? Some critical interpreters have suggested that Luke may also be writing for Christians experiencing persecution, but his message to those suffering for the faith is different from Mark’s. Rather than stressing that God is at work behind the scenes, even though it doesn’t seem like it, Luke may be showing Christians a model of how they, too, can suffer—like Jesus, the perfect martyr, who goes to his death confident of his own innocence, assured of God’s palpable presence in his life, calm and in control of the situation, knowing that suffering is necessary for the rewards of Paradise and that it will soon be over, leading to a blessed existence in the life to come.

The signs narrated in John include some of the favorite miracles known to Bible readers over the ages: turning the water into wine, healing the man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead. Jesus also preaches in this Gospel, not about the coming kingdom of God but about himself: who he is, where he has come from, where he is going, and how he can bring eternal life. Unique to John are the various “I am” sayings, in which Jesus identifies himself and what he can provide for people. These “I am” sayings are usually backed up by a sign, to show that what Jesus says about himself is true. And so he says “I am the bread of life” and proves it by multiplying the loaves to feed the multitudes; he says “I am the light of the world” and proves it by healing the man born blind; he says “I am the resurrection and the life” and proves it by raising Lazarus from the dead.

For many historical critics it makes sense that John, the Gospel that was written last, no longer speaks about the imminent appearance on earth of the Son of Man to sit in judgment on the earth, to usher in the utopian kingdom. In Mark, Jesus predicts that the end will come right away, during his own generation, while his disciples are still alive (Mark 9:1; 13:30). By the time John was written, probably from 90 to 95 CE, that earlier generation had died out and most if not all the disciples were already dead. That is, they died before the coming of the kingdom. What does one do with the teaching about an eternal kingdom here on earth if it never comes? One reinterprets the teaching. The way John reinterprets it is by altering the basic conceptualization

Around 100 BCE the combined understanding that we now call “Taoism” began seeking its own roots, attributing its foundation to three great teachers and their texts: Lao Tzu and the Tao Te Ching, Lieh Tzu, and Chuang Tzu, whose books were named after them.

The Tao, as such, wasn’t an organized religion, or even philosophy. It was but a loose method for interpreting the universe, Nature and the Road man may follow to live in harmony with it; and to these great mystics this was something experiential, beyond words or even the logic that they conceptualize.

Some scholars today believe that Lao Tzu and Lieh Tzu weren’t historical figures, or at least weren’t responsible for writing the texts that bear their names. Most likely, these great books were some kind of collective wisdom passed down from mendicant teachers to their students, and these mythic figures merely the ideal human expression of an enlightened master.

Cha Tao can be realized in the everyday life of any person. When guests come, a cup of tea is offered and conversation flows more smoothly. The culture of tea then becomes an interchange between friends and is often transmitted in this way. Later, one finds a kind of rich simplicity and abundant stillness through the ritual of drinking fine tea daily. The profundity found just beyond the silence that tea inspires is deep, giving rise to joy and reflection, contemplation and meditation. Without such introversion a life is incomplete. As we discussed earlier, so many of the problems in the modern world are directly related to an ignorance of the dialogue between Nature and Man that can only arise when all external stimuli are removed and tranquility is sought. A healthy life with serenity, equanimity, and wisdom is not a figment of ancient stories, nor just the aged beauty of those hoary scroll paintings. Even in this day one can live in harmony with the Tao.

The Way of Tea is not some somber religious ceremony held in dimly-lit halls by a bunch of solemn tea weirdoes chanting between sips. There is no cult of tea. The “teaists” I know find in tea a Way of sharing their inner peace with each other, of relaxing the ego, allowing us to be free and open with one another. Drinking tea with Tao is about letting go of all our “stuff” and just being ourselves as we really are, in our true nature. And that “original nature” is the Tao, is harmony with Nature itself, and does help us find that dialogue of “Man/Nature” so missing in the modern world.

they say tea was discovered by the legendary emperor and father of all medicine, Shen Nong (神農, the “Divine Farmer”). In one version of his tale, which also highlights the healing properties of tea, he eats some wicked poison, filling him with “seventy-two toxins.” Realizing he will soon die, he reaches up to try one more leaf in order to understand one more herb and thereby share one more medicine with his people. Of course, that leaf is tea, which they say then flushes the toxins from his old bones and rinses him clean. He then declares this wondrous leaf to be the “Emperor of All Medicinal Herbs.”

I’ve always felt that the “tea was medicine for thousands of years” summary is just way too reductionistic; it cuts too deep, leaves too much out… while I find myself standing in the wake of those “thousands of years” with a whirlwind of falling tea leaves swirling around me, each leaf shining with little gilded invitations to explore: Medicine? What do you mean medicine? Thousands of years? That is a long, long time! What happened? How is that different from tea now? Is tea still medicine?

As a result of these substances, tea has been found to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease. It also lowers blood-pressure, relieves stress and can help prevent diabetes. There is further evidence that it contributes to preventing eye diseases and even can help improve dental health. Some studies also claim that tea can increase bone density, helping prevent certain bone diseases like osteoporosis. Some of the less certain studies I found also talk a lot about how tea prevents cholesterol and contributes to proper digestion. Some studies claim that tea, or more often certain teas like green tea or puerh, can also contribute to weight loss. There are even some promising studies that suggest regular tea consumption can help improve memory. More research is required in all of these areas, some more than others, but most medical scientists agree that tea is a healthy beverage, and that the consumption of tea can help prevent various diseases.

There are some studies in the other direction, however, suggesting that fluoride in tea can be dangerous or that the microtoxins in puerh tea may also be detrimental to our health. However, as I mentioned, these studies are often conducted using mainstream tea bags and other “low quality” teas. I also wonder if fluoride in tea, for example, is due to irrigation, poor soil, agrochemicals or other modern issues and not to do with tea itself. In some studies, organic tea was found to contain much less fluoride, for example.

Since tea is originally a Chinese herb, it is worth introducing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) briefly and how tea fits within it. This situates tea as a plant medicine within the culture where it grew up, reaching a wizened maturity of many centuries old before it was shared with the rest of the world. It should be noted that while tea was raised and refined by centuries of Han Chinese appreciation and innovation—both in production and preparation—it was born in the aboriginal cultures of the Southwest of China, Laos, parts of India, Vietnam and Myanmar. Consequently, these peoples and cultures must also be honored in any worthy discussion of tea’s heritage. The main differences between allopathic medicine and TCM are in approach. In modern medicine, researchers and doctors focus on diseases and treatments for diseases. In TCM, the focus is on the individual patient, not the disease. This is obviously a strength in some cases and a weakness in others, like dealing with viruses for example. The TCM doctor has an aim to help the patient restore and maintain balance. In Western medicine, “disease” is considered to be something isolated from the patient—an independent entity. Thus, the allopathic doctor seeks to diagnose the “cause” of an illness and will determine that seven patients with the same symptoms and “cause” have the “same” disease. However, a TCM doctor would view the patterns of disharmony in these seven patients uniquely. The patterns are similar to the Western understanding of “disease” only in that they will determine a course of treatment, but not as a distinct entity. Rather, the TCM doctor observes patterns and relationships among the symptoms and contextualizes them within all areas of the patient’s life. TCM doctors do not seek the cause of symptoms, looking at them as part of a totality of the patient’s behavior, biography and even spiritual being.

There is a strong emphasis on preventative medicine in TCM, which is often something that allopathic doctors also talk about, but we rarely go to see an M.D. unless we are sick, whereas many TCM doctors traditionally helped “healthy” patients stay that way.

The stronger focus on preventative health moves the line of what is “medicine,” which may account for why “Chinese people used tea as medicine for thousands of years” while modern people tend to think of tea as a “beverage.” In the same way, TCM views a healthy, seasonal, macrobiotic diet as “medicine,” while it is very rare for a modern person to regard their food as “medicine.”

Yang (楊) literally was the sunny side of a sloping hill. Yang is any energy or force that is expanding, rising, growing, becoming. It is the “masculine” light of Heaven that is pushing, entering, penetrating and increasing. You could think of it as the intellect or mind in our experience. Yang is associated with heat, movement, activity, vigor, stimulation, excitement and outward or upward increase.

Yin (陰), on the other hand, is the shady side of a slope. Yin is any force that is sinking, absorbing, receiving or digesting.

Yin is associated with cold, rest, receptivity, darkness, the interior, tranquility and completion.

the older a tree is, the more Yin the tea will become, and the older we age the tea leaves themselves, the more Yin they become. Yin and Yang can also be applied to tea processing and preparation.

Fact: ceremony, religion and ritual are the origin of all tea consumption. All the four families of religious traditions found in China hold tea as sacred, each with their own rituals surrounding it. To the aboriginals, especially in tea’s birthplace of Yunnan, tea was plant medicine central to the shamanism of tribal spirituality. In Daoism, tea was a way to connect to Nature and balance oneself, achieving harmony. To the Buddhists, tea was one of the central mindfulness practices, fostering calm and focus through motion—applying the meditative mind to daily life. And to the Confucian, tea was a ritual that brought social harmony and fellowship, allowing our “humanity (ren, )” to flourish. Amazingly, tea is all of these things and more.

To be truly healthy, it is not enough for us to balance our own physical or psychological systems as though they are closed loops that can be controlled. You cannot find a healthy organism in an unhealthy environment—the fish in a polluted pond are also polluted. The imbalance in our collective spiritual wellbeing is therefore reflected in the state of our environment. For all our medical technology, advances in treatments and life-expectancy, we are surprisingly unhinged when it comes to the relationship we have to our home, our natural environment. A better relationship to mystery and Nature would create lifeways in harmony with its systems and truths.

here are seven aspects to tea quality: 1. The Environment The environment is the most influential factor in tea quality. This not only is the foundation for quality but also plays the largest role in the differences between teas. This means soil quality/composition and biodiversity, or lack of it. How much sun do the trees get? Is it morning or evening sun (different photosynthesis)? Is the land flat or sloped? (The latter of which allows for deeper roots.) You could also add what we call “cleanliness” to this, which means the local pollution, soil contaminants and whether or not agrochemicals are used.

2. The Trees This will also determine quality and the uniqueness of any given tea. Healthy vibrant trees produce high-quality tea. How old are the trees? Are they pollarded (cut down to make picking easier)? Are they seed-propagated or cloned cuttings? Which varietal/cultivar are they? All of these factors will be very influential.

5. Processing There are some types of tea where the environment is almost all of the quality of the tea, but for most teas the second half of quality will come through the manner and skill with which it is processed. The differences in processing techniques and skills are what makes a tea decent or a masterpiece. All tea is finished by a human. What method was used? Was it made by hand? Charcoal-roasted? All of this and more will define the tea.

TEA CULTIVATION AND PRO CESSING Te ubiquitous green tea bought and consumed today everywhere from Beijing to Baltimore— that is to say, a loose tea, the leaves of which have been panfred to wilt them, and then rolled and dried— dates back no further than about the twelfh century in China. Accustomed as we are to this kind of Chinese green tea, we might not immediately recognize the taste or appearance of the beverage that people were drinking in Tang or Song China. Probably in the earliest times (the Warring States period [ca. 475– 221 BCE] or perhaps even earlier), the beverage was made from freshly picked tea leaves that were not processed in any way (possibly they may have been dried in the sun). It could not have been a particularly stable product— it had to be consumed locally, more or less on the spot where tea was grown. Developments in tea pro cessing reﬂected the need to produce a substance that could be transported, stored, and prepared as a beverage wherever and whenever required. At some point before the Tang dynasty, although exactly when remains unclear, we fnd the development of tea cakes: unfermented tea leaves were steamed, mixed with some binding substance, and then molded into cakes that could be packed and transported over long distances
