IgM is our “early defense” antibody against antigens. It’s highly effective at tagging invaders for destruction by other cells, but it has a short life-span. So after IgM is produced, B cells switch over to IgG production, which gives us longer-term protection against an antigen. These IgG antibodies can linger for years or even a lifetime. IgA antibodies are the antibodies we have the most of, and that’s because they have to cover all of our mucosal surfaces, like our mouth, lungs, sinuses, and GI tract.

During deep sleep it’s normal to have higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6, which are triggered by melatonin and direct your immune cells to attack and kill anything that has found its way into your body during the day.

Obesity is itself a chronic inflammatory condition, because adipose (fat) cells secrete their own entourage of proinflammatory chemicals called adipokines. In fact, obese individuals can have a threefold increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP), all further contributing to chronic disease and accelerated aging.

Why are lymphatics so important? One, they deliver information about those toxins in your body to the immune cells so they can destroy or neutralize harmful substances. Two, the lymphatic system carries away harmful substances and any by-products formed by them. Three, they aid in the cleanup process to help heal and rebuild molecules in the area.

Inflammation in short periods is a good thing, because it’s a sign that your immune system is fighting foreign substances. Unfortunately, there are two phases of the inflammatory process. The first is pro-inflammation (taking care of the toxins and invaders), and the second is the cleanup and reparative stage. If this second stage is delayed or never happens, it can lead to autoimmune disease or chronic inflammation. But chronic inflammation—what happens when your arterial walls are constantly damaged—is what puts your body under constant stress, as it’s unable to keep up with the steady fights happening at the cellular level.

Not only do lymphatics perform the usual functions of immune support, fluid balance, and waste clearance, but they are also essential for large protein and fat molecules being transported from the gastrointestinal tract to the rest of the body. This is important because when the lymph system becomes porous and vital substances leak into other tissues, you lose the nutritional power of those substances, like vitamins, proteins, and other chemicals.

flow determines how the lymph nodes can identify (and thus get rid of) unwanted antigens. By that measure, the sooner these antigens can be carried by the lymphatic vessels to immune cells to establish a significant response, the sooner the inflammation can be cleared up.

extra weight is associated with increased risk of just about every health problem—heart attacks, cancer, fatigue, depression, sleep issues, inflammation, and more. One of the reasons: Fat, especially abdominal fat, is toxic to the organs that it’s near. It releases damaging and inflammatory substances that create all kinds of chaos throughout the body.

Whenever your muscles contract, they gently push the lymph fluid along. In addition, muscle contraction is one of the best ways to control the pressure of the lymphatic system, especially the core muscle of the diaphragm, which impacts the larger central lymphatic vessels that pass alongside of this muscle on their way to return lymph to the heart.

lymphatic system operates through pressure—and in-and-out rhythm—it does need something to constantly “prime the pump,” i.e., move the fluids along. A major pressure pump: deep, diaphragmatic breathing. This is why yoga stretches, yoga deep breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, and meditation are so crucial to healthy flow.

When they’re under stress—as the case when you lift something, be it a weight or your own body weight—the structures of the muscle break down and get torn apart. Your body knows this, repairs the damage, and builds them back up—this time, better and stronger in anticipation that you’ll do the damage again. This process is what builds all-important muscle in your body.

Yoga, on the other hand, essentially sends a shut-the-heck-up signal to the Golgi bodies, so that they do not engage.

where does the lymph come in? This muscle movement pushes lymph along, as it squeezes the lymph through the channels. But it also plays a role in allowing your muscles to relax, with assistance from the relaxation hormones triggered by yoga. This relaxation is key because it assists the flow in absence of that central pump, not to mention that different body positions sort of jostle the fluid in different directions—allowing gravity to assist in the up-down path that lymph must take to be most effective.

once you throw the Old Testament into the mix, things get completely jumbled. The authors of Job and Ecclesiastes explicitly state that there is no afterlife. The book of Amos insists that the people of God suffer because God is punishing them for their sins; the book of Job insists that the innocent can suffer; and the book of Daniel indicates that the innocent in fact will suffer.

To maintain the same volume of blood flow through our narrowed and stiffened blood vessels, the heart has to generate increased pressure. As a result, more than half of us develop hypertension by the age of sixty-five.

You do not worry about losing any of your capabilities. People tell you “the world is your oyster,” “the sky is the limit,” and so on. And you are willing to delay gratification—to invest years, for example, in gaining skills and resources for a brighter future. You seek to plug into bigger streams of knowledge and information.

There were also hundreds of indoor plants and a thriving vegetable and flower garden. The home had on-site child care for the staff and a new after-school program. Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase’s residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent. The study couldn’t say why. But Thomas thought he could. “I believe that the difference in death rates can be traced to the fundamental human need for a reason to live.”

In the early 1970s, the psychologists Judith Rodin and Ellen Langer performed an experiment in which they got a Connecticut nursing home to give each of its residents a plant. Half of them were assigned the job of watering their plant and attended a lecture on the benefits of taking on responsibilities in their lives. The other half had their plant watered for them and attended a lecture on how the staff was responsible for their well-being. After a year and a half, the group encouraged to take more responsibility—even for such a small thing as a plant—proved more active and alert and appeared to live longer.

Royce wanted to understand why simply existing—why being merely housed and fed and safe and alive—seems empty and meaningless to us. What more is it that we need in order to feel that life is worthwhile? The answer, he believed, is that we all seek a cause beyond ourselves. This was, to him, an intrinsic human need. The cause could be large (family, country, principle) or small (a building project, the care of a pet). The important thing was that, in ascribing value to the cause and seeing it as worth making sacrifices for, we give our lives meaning.

In the first stage, when a country is in extreme poverty, most deaths occur in the home because people don’t have access to professional diagnosis and treatment. In the second stage, when a country’s economy develops and its people transition to higher income levels, the greater resources make medical capabilities more widely available. People turn to health care systems when they are ill. At the end of life, they often die in the hospital instead of the home. In the third stage, as a country’s income climbs to the highest levels, people have the means to become concerned about the quality of their lives, even in sickness, and deaths at home actually rise again.

The day the lambs were slaughtered? How can that be? In Mark’s Gospel, Jesus lived through that day, had his disciples prepare the Passover meal, and ate it with them before being arrested, taken to jail for the night, tried the next morning, and executed at nine o’clock A.M. on the Passover day. But not in John. In John, Jesus dies a day earlier, on the Day of Preparation for the Passover, sometime after noon.

The commonly held view that Judas went out and “hanged himself” comes from Matthew (27:3–10). After Judas sees that his betrayal has led to Jesus’ conviction, he feels remorse and tries to return his pay of thirty pieces of silver to the Jewish chief priests, telling them that he has “sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They refuse to accept the money, however, so he throws it down in the Temple and goes out and hangs himself. The chief priests then collect the money, but decide that they cannot put it back into the Temple treasure because it is “blood money”—money that has been tainted with innocent blood. So they decide to put it to good use and purchase a “potter’s field,” presumably a field from which potters took clay, as a place to bury foreigners who died in Jerusalem. It is because it was purchased with Judas’s blood money, we are told, that the place “has been called the Field of Blood to this day.”

Paul’s letter to the Galatians he wants to insist that his Gospel message came directly from God himself, through Jesus. He didn’t get it from anyone else—not even the other apostles—so anyone who disagrees with him about the Gospel is really disagreeing not with him but with God. The writer of the book of Acts, on the other hand, wants to insist that there was complete continuity in every way among all the genuine apostles of Jesus, both the original disciples and Paul. They met, they talked, they agreed—time and again this is stated in Acts. For Paul himself, however, the issue is his authority, given straight from God. He did not confer with others or meet with the apostles. The two authors have different agendas and so have recounted the events differently—creating an interesting but important discrepancy.

scholars have sometimes suggested that Mark’s account was written in part to provide hope for those suffering persecution, to let them know that, appearances notwithstanding, God was at work behind suffering to achieve his redemptive purposes. What might Luke’s purpose have been in modifying Mark’s account, so that Jesus no longer dies in agony and despair? Some critical interpreters have suggested that Luke may also be writing for Christians experiencing persecution, but his message to those suffering for the faith is different from Mark’s. Rather than stressing that God is at work behind the scenes, even though it doesn’t seem like it, Luke may be showing Christians a model of how they, too, can suffer—like Jesus, the perfect martyr, who goes to his death confident of his own innocence, assured of God’s palpable presence in his life, calm and in control of the situation, knowing that suffering is necessary for the rewards of Paradise and that it will soon be over, leading to a blessed existence in the life to come.

The signs narrated in John include some of the favorite miracles known to Bible readers over the ages: turning the water into wine, healing the man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead. Jesus also preaches in this Gospel, not about the coming kingdom of God but about himself: who he is, where he has come from, where he is going, and how he can bring eternal life. Unique to John are the various “I am” sayings, in which Jesus identifies himself and what he can provide for people. These “I am” sayings are usually backed up by a sign, to show that what Jesus says about himself is true. And so he says “I am the bread of life” and proves it by multiplying the loaves to feed the multitudes; he says “I am the light of the world” and proves it by healing the man born blind; he says “I am the resurrection and the life” and proves it by raising Lazarus from the dead.

For many historical critics it makes sense that John, the Gospel that was written last, no longer speaks about the imminent appearance on earth of the Son of Man to sit in judgment on the earth, to usher in the utopian kingdom. In Mark, Jesus predicts that the end will come right away, during his own generation, while his disciples are still alive (Mark 9:1; 13:30). By the time John was written, probably from 90 to 95 CE, that earlier generation had died out and most if not all the disciples were already dead. That is, they died before the coming of the kingdom. What does one do with the teaching about an eternal kingdom here on earth if it never comes? One reinterprets the teaching. The way John reinterprets it is by altering the basic conceptualization
